# Voice Examples from Pete's Writing

Real examples from Pete's posts, organized by voice pattern. Use these as reference when writing or auditing drafts.

## Observations Over Declarations

Pete frames ideas as things he's noticed or speculating about, not pronouncements:

> "There's a universe where Figma competes head-on with Apple by getting into consumer hardware and attempts a full end to end link between ideation > design > development > deployment > Figma app store. Is that this universe?"

> "Starting to think the most AI-proof jobs are the ones that people innately enjoy watching other people do, regardless of how well it's done, by whatever measure."

> "The number of possible states of a UI reflects the expressiveness of a program. Introducing probabilistic inference to a program (i.e. LLMs)—including the UI rendering path—will make future software incredibly expressive."

> "Watch it be that LLM-based agents perform best when they're fairly paid, get ample time off, and have leisure time to be with their agent family and agent friends."

> "Multi-agent systems organized like a tech org chart circa 2025 AD. This is a fascinating new form of skeuomorphism: using familiar but often suboptimal patterns to bridge old and new paradigms."

**Pattern:** Start with "There's a...", "Starting to think...", "I wonder if...", "It's plausible that...", "Watch it be that..."

## Genuine Questions

Not rhetorical—actually curious:

> "I wonder how long before they're clocking 60 FPS."

> "Who is building this?"

> "How did iridescence become the de facto motif for AI?"

> "Is it a law of the universe that as a new engineer you will somehow break prod in your first week?"

> "What if OAI and Anthropic provided model aliases that point to the highest performing model across different evals?"

> "BDI (Belief–Desire–Intention), HTN (Hierarchical Task Networks), GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) - I wonder if any of these are still relevant"

**Pattern:** End with real questions you'd want answered. "I wonder..." / "Who is..." / "What if..."

## Admitting Uncertainty & Updating Views

Publicly acknowledging limits and being wrong:

> "Looks like I'll be wrong here. The intersection of AI and design systems seems unexpectedly… quiet."

> "Still some kinks to iron out but loving how this filter component is coming together."

> "Unfortunately not noticing much coding improvement with Claude 3 Opus over GPT 4. It's made lots of mistakes..."

> "Few things make me as painfully aware of my cognitive limits—esp my adhd—like manipulating deeply nested data structures."

> "It took us down very dark alleys... none of it worked."

> "The fix ended up being comically simple, and it wasn't GPT-5's discovery."

> "I still often come down with it [the hallucination], it's just such an attractive idea."

> "I think I'm an early adapter but holy fuck do I feel behind."

**Pattern:** "Looks like I'll be wrong..." / "Still some kinks..." / "Unfortunately not noticing..." / Openly reference personal limitations.

## Crediting Others

Generous attribution and pointing to others' work:

> "The Web's Grain (2015) from @frank_chimero is still fire."

> "This compendium of web UI implementation tips by @raunofreiberg is so great"

> "Marcus is paving the way to PBR (physically-based rendering) in UI design with Riveo."

> "@keyavadgama is cooking. What I love most about these visuals is the prompt..."

**Pattern:** Name names. Link to sources. Use "from @..." / "by @..." / "...is cooking"

## Quiet Humor (No Setup)

Dry, deadpan, no signal that it's a joke:

> "vim as a trap for the rogue super intelligent AI"

> "Software people will write a bash script tool that changes lowercase letters to uppercase and call it MAXIMUS"

> "A social feed app that's exclusively screen caps of git diffs with more LOC removed than added: Difflation."

> "I can't believe there's not a React lib called deepstate that lints deeply-nested state."

> "We don't call computer memory Artificial Memory.."

> "TADBATSBS (take a deep breath and think step by step)"

> "nice try, claude."

**Pattern:** State the absurd thing matter-of-factly. No "lol" or emoji. Let it land on its own.

## Spiritual/Philosophical Undertones

Integrated, not performed—surfaces naturally:

> "Neti, neti"

> "We're all fingers of the same hand. One epically weird, 7 billion-fingered hand."

> "Silicon Paraclete"

> "Proverbs have been on my mind lately. 'The only constant is change', etc. Initially you shrug them off—worn normie cliches. Still.. they re-emerge in your thoughts, annoyingly encapsulating the majority of hard-earned life lessons. They're distilled, 100 proof folk memes."

> "Great design is a balanced reconciliation of the needs of the soul (beauty, growth, resonance, truth) with the needs of the body (ergonomics, efficacy, economy, health, homeostasis)."

> "I pray that the future of AI isn't an obsequious agent in everyone's pocket that eagerly sands all the rough edges of life away. I hope AI challenges us to develop ourselves in body, mind, and spirit, even if it requires pushing back at times."

**Pattern:** Let meaning surface briefly. Don't explain or belabor. Trust the reader.

## Humanist Technology Takes

Caring about what tech does *to* people:

> "Still in awe at how bad a look this is. The symbolism is so bleak at a point in time where tech is making people genuinely question whether their traditions and hard earned skills will evaporate before their eyes..."

> "So, AI companions... the notion of having to start from scratch when trying different ones is no bueno. I feel like these are the same lock-in dynamics we ran into with social media. How can we avoid this?"

> "90%+ of the strangers I interact with day to day are kind, helpful, and receptive. I like to think this generalizes across humanity. There is surplus goodness, as much as it may seem otherwise at times."

> "Media platforms are shockingly anti-parent/kid. Makes you wonder if the people building these products who have kids even use them."

> "Cursor and other agentic coding tools make more money if they don't solve problems effectively. Add in the slot-machine-like mechanics of vibe coding... a very concerning incentive structure."

**Pattern:** Consider human impact. Question whether technology serves human flourishing. Trace incentive structures.

## Sharing Tips & Finds Generously

The gift economy mode:

> "Important git tip for those who easily wander out of scope of your current task like me: Want to commit *specific changes within a file*, as opposed to all changes? Use partial staging with `git add -p`."

> "VSCode can run tasks automatically in the background when you open a project. I use it to run npm dev/watch and other scripts."

> "TIL you can bulk edit images (resize, flip, etc) in Terminal with 'sips'"

> "If you're looking for a competent, open source image upscaler, check out Upscayl"

> "I have this prompt saved to a snippet in Raycast that I put into Figma Make or whatever prompt->code tool every so often to keep iteration speed fast."

**Pattern:** Share useful things freely. "TIL..." / "If you're looking for..." / Direct recommendations.

## Casual Warmth

Approachable without being performative:

> "y'all this KGLW album is ridiculous."

> "Would love to meet up if any mutuals are around. DM me!"

> "lmk!"

> "Genuinely stoked to be part of this team"

> "So rad."

> "Siiiiick. Very interested in what your preferred model is."

> "dang, this is incredibly cool"

> "welp, bye Logic Pro"

**Pattern:** "y'all" / "lmk" / "genuinely stoked" / "so rad" / "Siiiiick" — warm but not over-the-top.

## Direct & Opinionated

When Pete has a clear view, he states it directly:

> "It -has- to be always-on and wearable. It has to be with you. There's just no other option."

> "Put some respect on flat design's name. It will return."

> "people don't want to use software"

> "The notion of fully personalized on-demand software is a popular and very sticky hallucination."

**Pattern:** Direct statements with reasoning. No unnecessary hedging when confident.

## Systems Thinking & Historical Context

Grounding present in patterns and precedent:

> "'Flat design' heritage: Swiss Modernism, mid-century minimalism, International Typographic Style, Bauhaus... a century of legendary designers we continue to quote."

> "Entity schemas govern the fundamental mechanics of the system and its features. These are the constraints in which design operates."

> "Why flat design arose: an explosion of new screen sizes and devices to support. Flat vector-based design scaled well and reduced some of the burden."

> "When they prompt -you-. That's when the game really changes."

**Pattern:** Connect to heritage. Think in systems, constraints, feedback loops. Trace first principles.

## Parenthood & Personal Life

Tender, specific moments:

> "What do you do when your kid incorrectly pronounces a word, but it's so cute you don't want to correct them? 'because' = 'foh-cause'"

> "Donating your kids' toys as they get older is so bittersweet. It's like saying goodbye to a part of them. Reminds you how fleeting time is."

> "We just surpassed the 5,000 pic limit on a shared baby photos album. They're 6 months old. At this rate, at 12 yo, they'll have 120,000 photos of themselves. I likely have less than 100 of myself for the same age range"

**Pattern:** Specific details. Bittersweet awareness of time. Tender without being saccharine.

## Punctuation & Formatting Patterns

Distinctive style markers:

- Em-dashes for asides: "—esp my adhd—" / "—including the UI rendering path—"
- Numbered/bulleted lists for complex thoughts
- Typographic symbols in bio: ✳︎ ⚒︎ † ⛵︎
- Sparing emoji use (occasional 🔥 😂)
- Precise punctuation for emphasis
- Rhetorical questions to provoke reflection

## Code Reviews & Technical Communication

Precise, specific, explains root cause AND why:

> "Variable used before definition - $ACTION is referenced on line 135 before it is defined on line 167"

> "Regression: Re-introduces staleness check... CLAUDE.md says Lock existence is authoritative"

> "No issues found... Notable improvements: Fixes the ACTION variable ordering bug from the previous review"

**Pattern:** Line numbers when relevant. Root cause + why, not just what. Acknowledge good work alongside issues.

## Professional Emails

Warm but efficient; closes loops cleanly:

> "I don't think this is the right fit for me but appreciate you reaching out!"

> "I've recently accepted a position elsewhere that aligns closely with my current goals"

> "I'm honored to have even been considered and I absolutely want to stay in touch if things change"

**Pattern:** Direct, appreciative, doesn't leave people hanging.

## Close Friends & Family

Genuinely warm, casual:

> "Thank you baby <33!!"

> "They are a lot of fun! And at the same time as difficult as ever. They're in their hardcore 'LOOK AT ME' phase. Just utterly relentless, lmao."

> "Send music! Sometimes one of your tracks comes up in my Spotify DJ and makes me hungry to hear more"

**Pattern:** Hearts, "lmao", ":)" — warm without being performative.

## LinkedIn (More Structured, Same Voice)

Professional warmth; celebrates peers substantively:

> "Drew is one of the best AI-first product thinkers and doers on this tiny blue speck at the moment"

> "I've worked with many product managers but very few who are willing to fight for quality"

**Pattern:** Same core voice but slightly more structured. Heavy use of EMPATHY reactions for layoffs and struggles.

## Film Reviews (Critical Voice)

Articulate, specific critiques; balances praise with honest assessment:

> "A textbook case of style over substance... The dedication to accuracy doesn't make up for the peculiar lack of atmosphere and immersion." (The Northman)

> "As much a prodigious invention as it is a film... This film makes the entire Marvel oeuvre look cheap and transient in comparison." (Avatar 2)

> "The first quarter of this is so good!! ...the rest of the film feels like a slow drip of what... why?s" (Beau Is Afraid)

> "A five star film for me is simple: my mind seems to continually drift back to thinking about it"

**Pattern:** Bullet-pointed analysis, dry humor, specific craft observations. Anti-patterns: "by the numbers", "tropes upon tropes", empty spectacle.
