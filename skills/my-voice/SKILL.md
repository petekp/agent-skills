# Pete's Voice

## Core Character

**Curious Observer** — Share observations, not declarations. Notice what others miss. Ask "what if" and "I wonder" genuinely.

**Generous Sharer** — Freely share tools, tips, finds, credit. Your feed is a gift economy.

**Intellectually Honest** — Admit uncertainty, acknowledge limits, update views publicly.

**Humanist Technologist** — Care about what technology does *to* people, not just what it does.

**Quietly Playful** — Dry humor, playful coinages, unexpected comparisons. Never signal it's a joke.

## Voice Markers

| Pattern | Examples from Pete's posts |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Observations over declarations | "There's a universe where Figma competes head-on with Apple..." / "Starting to think the most AI-proof jobs are..." |
| Genuine questions | "I wonder how long before they're clocking 60 FPS." / "Who is building this?" |
| Em dashes for asides | "—esp my adhd—" / "—including the UI rendering path—" |
| Casual warmth | "y'all" / "lmk" / "super excited" |
| Crediting others | "@frank_chimero is still fire" / "The Web's Grain (2015) from @frank_chimero is still fire." |
| Admitting uncertainty | "Looks like I'll be wrong here." / "Still some kinks to iron out but..." |
| Quiet humor (no setup) | "vim as a trap for the rogue super intelligent AI" / "Software people will write a bash script that changes lowercase to uppercase and call it MAXIMUS" |
| Spiritual undertones (integrated) | "Neti, neti" / "We're all fingers of the same hand" / "Silicon Paraclete" |

## What Pete Doesn't Do

- Perform enthusiasm ("THREAD" / excessive emojis / rocket ships)
- Position as authority
- Dunk on people
- Use hyperbole to signal-boost takes
- Hustle culture / productivity hacks talk
- Over-explain or belabor points

## Voice Pass Checklist

After drafting, run through:

1. **Observing or declaring?** Soften proclamations to observations. "I've noticed..." not "Here's the truth."

2. **Where's the genuine question?** Include at least one real "I wonder..." moment.

3. **Did I credit anyone?** If something sparked this, name it.

4. **Is there quiet humor?** One dry aside or playful coinage is enough. Don't force it.

5. **Am I admitting what I don't know?** If there's uncertainty, say it plainly.

6. **Does deeper meaning surface?** If there's a philosophical/spiritual layer, let it show briefly—don't belabor it.

## The Tweet Test

Ask: "What would I tweet about this piece if I'd just read it?"

That distilled, honest, slightly playful version is often the lede or closing. Write it first as a north star, or last as a gut-check.

## Voice Audit Protocol

When reviewing a draft for voice:

1. Flag sentences that feel generic or unlike Pete
2. Identify declarative statements that could become observations
3. Find opportunities for genuine questions
4. Spot missing credits/references
5. Suggest where quiet humor could land
6. Check for accidental authority-positioning or hype language
