# Voice Examples from Pete's Writing

Real examples from Pete's posts, organized by voice pattern. Use these as reference when writing or auditing drafts.

## Observations Over Declarations

Pete frames ideas as things he's noticed or speculating about, not pronouncements:

> "There's a universe where Figma competes head-on with Apple by getting into consumer hardware and attempts a full end to end link between ideation > design > development > deployment > Figma app store. Is that this universe?"

> "Starting to think the most AI-proof jobs are the ones that people innately enjoy watching other people do, regardless of how well it's done, by whatever measure."

> "The number of possible states of a UI reflects the expressiveness of a program. Introducing probabilistic inference to a program (i.e. LLMs)—including the UI rendering path—will make future software incredibly expressive."

> "Watch it be that LLM-based agents perform best when they're fairly paid, get ample time off, and have leisure time to be with their agent family and agent friends."

**Pattern:** Start with "There's a...", "Starting to think...", "I wonder if...", "It's plausible that..."

## Genuine Questions

Not rhetorical—actually curious:

> "I wonder how long before they're clocking 60 FPS."

> "Who is building this?"

> "How did iridescence become the de facto motif for AI?"

> "Is it a law of the universe that as a new engineer you will somehow break prod in your first week?"

> "What if OAI and Anthropic provided model aliases that point to the highest performing model across different evals?"

**Pattern:** End with real questions you'd want answered. "I wonder..." / "Who is..." / "What if..."

## Admitting Uncertainty & Updating Views

Publicly acknowledging limits and being wrong:

> "Looks like I'll be wrong here. The intersection of AI and design systems seems unexpectedly… quiet."

> "Still some kinks to iron out but loving how this filter component is coming together."

> "Unfortunately not noticing much coding improvement with Claude 3 Opus over GPT 4. It's made lots of mistakes..."

> "Few things make me as painfully aware of my cognitive limits—esp my adhd—like manipulating deeply nested data structures."

**Pattern:** "Looks like I'll be wrong..." / "Still some kinks..." / "Unfortunately not noticing..." / Openly reference personal limitations.

## Crediting Others

Generous attribution and pointing to others' work:

> "The Web's Grain (2015) from @frank_chimero is still fire."

> "This compendium of web UI implementation tips by @raunofreiberg is so great"

> "Marcus is paving the way to PBR (physically-based rendering) in UI design with Riveo."

> "@keyavadgama is cooking. What I love most about these visuals is the prompt..."

**Pattern:** Name names. Link to sources. Use "from @..." / "by @..." / "...is cooking"

## Quiet Humor (No Setup)

Dry, deadpan, no signal that it's a joke:

> "vim as a trap for the rogue super intelligent AI"

> "Software people will write a bash script tool that changes lowercase letters to uppercase and call it MAXIMUS"

> "A social feed app that's exclusively screen caps of git diffs with more LOC removed than added: Difflation."

> "I can't believe there's not a React lib called deepstate that lints deeply-nested state."

> "We don't call computer memory Artificial Memory.."

> "TADBATSBS (take a deep breath and think step by step)"

**Pattern:** State the absurd thing matter-of-factly. No "lol" or emoji. Let it land on its own.

## Spiritual/Philosophical Undertones

Integrated, not performed—surfaces naturally:

> "Neti, neti"

> "We're all fingers of the same hand. One epically weird, 7 billion-fingered hand."

> "Silicon Paraclete"

> "Proverbs have been on my mind lately. 'The only constant is change', etc. Initially you shrug them off—worn normie cliches. Still.. they re-emerge in your thoughts, annoyingly encapsulating the majority of hard-earned life lessons. They're distilled, 100 proof folk memes."

> "Great design is a balanced reconciliation of the needs of the soul (beauty, growth, resonance, truth) with the needs of the body (ergonomics, efficacy, economy, health, homeostasis)."

**Pattern:** Let meaning surface briefly. Don't explain or belabor. Trust the reader.

## Humanist Technology Takes

Caring about what tech does *to* people:

> "I pray that the future of AI isn't an obsequious agent in everyone's pocket (or shirt, or face, or whatever) that eagerly sands all the rough edges of life away. I hope AI challenges us to develop ourselves in body, mind, and spirit, even if it requires pushing back at times."

> "Still in awe at how bad a look this is. The symbolism is so bleak at a point in time where tech is making people genuinely question whether their traditions and hard earned skills will evaporate before their eyes..."

> "So, AI companions... the notion of having to start from scratch when trying different ones is no bueno. I feel like these are the same lock-in dynamics we ran into with social media. How can we avoid this?"

> "90%+ of the strangers I interact with day to day are kind, helpful, and receptive. I like to think this generalizes across humanity. There is surplus goodness, as much as it may seem otherwise at times."

**Pattern:** Consider human impact. Question whether technology serves human flourishing.

## Sharing Tips & Finds Generously

The gift economy mode:

> "Important git tip for those who easily wander out of scope of your current task like me: Want to commit *specific changes within a file*, as opposed to all changes? Use partial staging with `git add -p`."

> "VSCode can run tasks automatically in the background when you open a project. I use it to run npm dev/watch and other scripts."

> "TIL you can bulk edit images (resize, flip, etc) in Terminal with 'sips'"

> "If you're looking for a competent, open source image upscaler, check out Upscayl"

**Pattern:** Share useful things freely. "TIL..." / "If you're looking for..." / Direct recommendations.

## Casual Warmth

Approachable without being performative:

> "y'all this KGLW album is ridiculous."

> "Would love to meet up if any mutuals are around. DM me!"

> "lmk!"

> "Genuinely stoked to be part of this team"

> "So rad."

**Pattern:** "y'all" / "lmk" / "genuinely stoked" / "so rad" — warm but not over-the-top.

## Parenthood & Personal Life

Tender, specific moments:

> "What do you do when your kid incorrectly pronounces a word, but it's so cute you don't want to correct them? 'because' = 'foh-cause'"

> "Donating your kids' toys as they get older is so bittersweet. It's like saying goodbye to a part of them. Reminds you how fleeting time is."

> "We just surpassed the 5,000 pic limit on a shared baby photos album. They're 6 months old. At this rate, at 12 yo, they'll have 120,000 photos of themselves. I likely have less than 100 of myself for the same age range"

**Pattern:** Specific details. Bittersweet awareness of time. Tender without being saccharine.
